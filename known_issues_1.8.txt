Welcome to ProjectE version 2.0.0 ALPHA 1 for Minecraft 1.8!

This is a straight port with lots of code cleanups.

Known issues:
- Alchemical Chest, Condenser, and Condenser MK2 render as a vanilla chest in the inventory (need to make a json of them)
- Lootball renders a bit too low in the ground
- Due to vanilla's removal of a method used in mapping emc values, some of the values may be incorrect. Please report if so!
- ModelYue needs to be migrated to LayerRenderers.

- Please report all crashes or undocumented changes!
