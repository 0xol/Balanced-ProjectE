Welcome to ProjectE version 2.0.0 ALPHA 1 for Minecraft 1.8!

This is mainly a straight port.

Known issues:
- Alchemical Chest, Condenser, and Condenser MK2 render as a vanilla chest in the inventory
- Pedestal does not update clientside on login / chunk reload until it is opened. Seems to be a 1.8 change.
- Items that continually consume emc (swrg, ignition, etc.) will repeatedly play the "item switchout" animation.
This is 1.8 being overly eager to play the animation, and there's nothing I can do
- Lootball renders a bit too low in the ground
- Due to vanilla's removal of a method used in mapping emc values, some of the values may be incorrect. Please report if so!
-

- Please report all crashes or undocumented changes!
